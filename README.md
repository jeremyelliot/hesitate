# js-input-stopped-event
Custom javascript event dispatched when the value of an input field has not changed for _n_ milliseconds.

Waiting until a user has possibly stopped typing before doing something with their input can be useful. 
For example, reduce the number of redundant lookup requests for autocomplete fields.
